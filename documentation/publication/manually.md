# Publish manually

In the case you don't use [GitHub Actions](github_action.md) you can still publish the website manually by running the command `journal publish` locally inside your repository.

This will automatically create the `gh-pages` branch and commit to it.

**Note**: even though publishing manually is easy you still have to remember to do it (so it's easy to forget), that's why publishing via a [GitHub Action](github_action.md) is recommended.
