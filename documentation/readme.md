# Journal

`halsey/journal` is a simple tool to transform your documentation written with markdown into a website hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).

This tool is tailored toward the needs of the [Innmind](https://github.com/innmind/) organization. If you need a more generic approach you should take a look at [Couscous](https://couscous.io).
